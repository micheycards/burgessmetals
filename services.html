  <h2> Project Management</h2>

    <p>Burgess Metals provides a single source of responsibility for project coordination, communication, scheduling, and workforce staffing, our project managers work hand-in-hand with our pre-construction staff to achieve a seamless project transition from pre-construction to construction. With project construction as their single focus, each project manager is dedicated to a customer's project, from beginning to end. Understanding that customer service and satisfaction is of utmost priority, Burgess Metals continuously updates education and training for its project managers so they can properly support our project requirements.</p>

 <h2>Safety</h2>
    <p>Since safety is extremely important throughout the construction of each project, all project managers hold many of the same safety training certifications mandated for the field Foremen and personnel. Safety is integrated into every construction project by planning and pre-planning various construction activities. Each of Burgess Metals Sheet Metal foremen receives continuous education and updates on safety. </p>

<h2>Field Services </h2>
   <p>Supported by a talented group of trade professionals in the field, Burgess Metals project managers supervise and support Foremen assigned to each construction project.  Depending on project type, a Foreman for each labor discipline is assigned to work for our project managers and supervise the day-to-day labor activities on site.
<h2>Computer Aided Drafting and Design (CADD)</h2>

    <p>Burgess Metals MEPF Overhead Coordination Drawings utilizes CADD in either 2D or 3D formats.   This allows extremely accurate coordination of Architectural floor ans, Structural, Mechanical Duct and HVAC Piping, Electrical, Plumbing, Fire Protection, Architectural Reflected ceilings, etc. on all new and existing (if applicable) construction Projects.  Burgess Metals brings over 30 years of Sheet Metal coordination experience from some of West Central Floridas most complex high profile projects.</p>



<h2>Thinking Green </h2>
   <p>In addition to other industry specific training, most of our project managers are Green Advantage Certified and some are LEED Accredited Professionals. Trained and aware of many green initiatives, including LEED, our project managers understand the requirements and coordination required to achieve a sustainable building or even LEED certification. Burgess Metals embraces a philosophy that all team members from Pre-Construction to Construction need to be educated regarding green solutions for optimum results on LEED or other projects with a goal to be Green.</p>

<h2>On-Site Communication </h2>
    <p>Equipped with smart devices to allow immediate communication and data transfer to our office, project managers, and customers, Burgess Metals Sheet Metal foremen are able to facilitate quick and efficient communication. Whether it is requesting material procurement, scheduling a delivery, or clarifying a job specification, our Sheet Metal Foremen are equipped to communicate effectively and efficiently from each job site.</p>
